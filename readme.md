The perfect font pattern for risograph printing.
Asistemática* Alphabet is typographic-pattern-project, it mixes the art and craft and type development.
The letters first were cutted and printed in linoleum, then they were organized into a font family. The linoleum and the digital letters were used to set two different «spe-zines», one hand printed and the order risograph printed.
Asistematica is an Spe-Zine / font / patterns project.
